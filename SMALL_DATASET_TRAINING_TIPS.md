# StyleTTS2 Training Tips for Small Datasets (108 Samples)

## Based on Official Docs & Community Experience

### ðŸ“Š Epoch Recommendations

#### For Your Dataset (108 samples â†’ ~1600 with augmentation):
- **First Stage**: 200-250 epochs (not 400!)
- **Validation Loss Target**: 0.3-0.4
- **Your Progress**: 0.572 at epoch 150 is on track!

#### Why Not 400 Epochs?
1. **Community reports**: Good models achieved with 200 epochs
2. **Time efficiency**: 200-250 epochs = 3-5 hours
3. **Diminishing returns**: Minor improvements after epoch 200
4. **Overfitting risk**: Too many epochs on small data

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

| Epoch Range | Expected Val Loss | Status |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| 1-50        | 1.0 â†’ 0.7       | Learning basics |
| 50-100      | 0.7 â†’ 0.5       | Good progress |
| 100-150     | 0.5 â†’ 0.4       | Refinement |
| 150-200     | 0.4 â†’ 0.35      | Fine-tuning |
| 200+        | < 0.35          | Watch for overfitting |

### âš¡ Training Speed Tips

1. **Early Stopping**: Stop if validation loss doesn't improve for 30-50 epochs
2. **Monitor Closely**: Check validation loss every 10-20 epochs
3. **Best Checkpoint**: May not be the final epoch!

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Optimizations

Already implemented in your config:
- âœ… Data augmentation (108 â†’ ~1600 samples)
- âœ… Appropriate learning rates
- âœ… Delayed diffusion training (epoch 30)
- âœ… Memory-efficient settings

### ðŸ“ˆ What to Expect

**Hours 1-2**: Rapid improvement (loss drops quickly)
**Hours 2-4**: Steady progress (approaching 0.4-0.5)
**Hours 4-6**: Fine refinement (approaching final loss)

### ðŸš¨ When to Stop Training

Stop if you see:
1. Validation loss increasing for 30+ epochs
2. Validation loss plateaued for 50+ epochs
3. Training loss << validation loss (overfitting)
4. Reached target loss (0.3-0.4)

### ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips from Community

1. **Small datasets train fast**: Even 200 epochs takes only 3-5 hours
2. **Quality over quantity**: Better to stop at epoch 180 with good loss than overtrain to 400
3. **Your current progress**: 0.572 at epoch 150 suggests you'll reach ~0.4 by epoch 200-250

### ðŸŽ‰ Bottom Line

**You don't need 400 epochs!** 200-250 is optimal for your augmented dataset. You're already on track with good progress at epoch 150.
