# Strategies to Improve Validation Loss (Currently at 0.572)

## Immediate Actions

### 1. **Continue Training (Most Important)**
Your validation loss is still decreasing. Continue for another 150-200 epochs:
```bash
cd /root/StyleTTS2
accelerate launch train_first.py --config_path ./Configs/config_multispeaker_continue.yml
```

### 2. **Data Augmentation**
With only 108 samples, augmentation is crucial:
```bash
python augment_data.py
# Then update config to use augmented data
```

### 3. **Learning Rate Schedule**
The config uses reduced learning rates:
- lr: 0.00005 (half of original)
- This helps fine-tune without overshooting

## Advanced Strategies

### 4. **Regularization Techniques**
- Increase dropout slightly (0.2 → 0.25) if overfitting
- Add weight decay if not present

### 5. **Monitor Specific Losses**
Track individual loss components:
- **Monotonic loss (lambda_mono)**: Should decrease steadily
- **S2S loss (lambda_s2s)**: Critical for alignment quality
- **TMA_epoch**: Currently 5, could experiment with 10

### 6. **Gradient Accumulation**
If you want larger effective batch size:
```python
# Add to train_first.py
accumulation_steps = 2  # Effective batch_size = 32
```

## Expected Progress

With small datasets:
- Epoch 1-50: Rapid improvement (1.085 → ~0.8)
- Epoch 50-150: Steady improvement (0.8 → 0.572)
- Epoch 150-300: Slow refinement (0.572 → ~0.4-0.5)
- Epoch 300+: Marginal gains, watch for overfitting

## Validation Loss Targets

For 108 samples:
- **Good**: 0.4-0.5
- **Very Good**: 0.3-0.4
- **Excellent**: < 0.3 (might indicate overfitting)

## Monitoring Overfitting

Check if training loss << validation loss:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir Models/ThreeSpeaker/tensorboard
```

If overfitting occurs:
1. Stop training
2. Use checkpoint with best validation loss
3. Add more regularization or augmentation

## When to Stop

Stop training when:
1. Validation loss increases for 20+ epochs
2. Validation loss plateaus for 50+ epochs
3. Training loss approaches 0 while validation stays high

## Quick Commands

Resume training with lower LR:
```bash
cd /root/StyleTTS2
accelerate launch train_first.py --config_path ./Configs/config_multispeaker_continue.yml
```

Monitor progress:
```bash
# Terminal 1
tail -f Models/ThreeSpeaker/train.log | grep "Validation loss"

# Terminal 2
watch -n 10 'ls -lht Models/ThreeSpeaker/epoch_1st_*.pth | head -5'
```
