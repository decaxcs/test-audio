speaker_m/speaker_m_0026.wav|know, sometimes people will bring in a date and then a few months later they, you know, come in with a set|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0039.wav|The whole point of this is that you ask for it. That you want it. I need you to want to be raped by you. I'm not going to ask for it.|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0027.wav|of matching rocks on their fingers and then a few months after that, well, you know, many versions of themselves. I suppose|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0034.wav|You total fucking son. And I didn't wish that was your mouth. Your mouth was bouncing up and down on his cot like that. They used to gripping your face so tightly.|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0020.wav|and fit small talk into the five minutes where I make your espresso, but what like specifically do you do? Uh-huh. Oh,|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0038.wav|You're going to be a little boy. Well, sorry, but that's not going to work. If this is just barely rape and yes or force and so on you, that's no fun.|1

speaker_m/speaker_m_0036.wav|things. Um, I like you. And I can see this going somewhere. You know, um, I can see this going further than|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0022.wav|is the kind of reaction that I wanted. I wanted his cock to get hard and it's proof that this final work, because deep down inside, you're a sadist, aren't you? You're|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0023.wav|a degree in creative writing and, uh, I don't know. Things don't entirely pan out the way you think they will, but|2
speaker_m/speaker_m_0025.wav|the new faces that come and go and then the old ones and what new things are happening in their lives. You|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0023.wav|getting off of this. Do you want me to? Oh, it's perfect. Oh, it's so perfect. Oh, I want you to get off more of this, okay? No. So I have a|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0000.wav|Okay, then in that case, how does 9 o'clock tonight sound? Okay, well, I'll see you there then. Have a good day|2

speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0018.wav|okay? Oh. And I really don't think that you treat me better than my boyfriend does. Especially since you're getting hard off of this. You're fucking getting off on me. You're taking|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0009.wav|get to know each other better. I feel like that's probably a good thing to do. Yeah. If you want, there is|2
speaker_f/speaker_f_0038.wav|This is a slap harder though. It's not that hard. Is that all you got, huh? You? Oh, fuck.|0
speaker_m/speaker_m_0002.wav|say it outside of the cafe, you look really nice. Come in please. How did your work day end up being? Oh,|2

speaker_m/speaker_m_0033.wav|we do, um, no pressure, obviously, but I definitely don't mind if you doubt. Okay, that was a very enthusiastic response. Well,|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0036.wav|don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it. I'm not going to ask for it like that. I'm not asking for it like that. I'm|1

speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0037.wav|not going to betray my boyfriend like that. Just fucking rate me whatever I don't care. But I'm not going to ask for it. Well, you're not going to ask for it.|1
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0010.wav|it was an elementary school? I don't know. I think she had it since the 4th grade. Oh my god, it don't look so embarrassed, dude. This crush will be the last|1

speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0015.wav|like you. He has the biggest crush on you ever. He's had it since we were kids, but lately it's been a bit of a problem. Yeah, you know. Ever since you|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0018.wav|you showed up every day and that you were a patient and polite when asking me. Yeah, of course. So, what exactly|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0005.wav|to, you would have stopped me. You don't call the cops by now. Please, please. I would probably be in a hands-butt. You haven't done any of that. You should stop here.|1

speaker_m/speaker_m_0004.wav|glad. You know, I can't have you swanning up to some other cafe, not in my watch anyway. You want my favorite|2
speaker_m/speaker_m_0005.wav|regular after all, and a little possessive of you. I'm just kidding. By the way, I'm totally kidding. Okay, I'm glad. I'm|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0012.wav|pants right now. And it's all because I kidnapped your crush. This is not kind of embarrassing. This is not kind of fucked up. It's a boy sweet and kind to float|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0008.wav|roomy enough and got a couch and a TV. And I don't know. We could like play some music or just talk,|2
speaker_f/speaker_f_0021.wav|to make you hard. Okay, sure. Fine. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.|0

speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0000.wav|I went into a huge, a little brain of yours. Afro, DZX was. Why did you... There they go! The answer missing my cute brain. I wonder what's going through that pretty|1
speaker_f/speaker_f_0035.wav|oh my god. Oh, you mean so rough. Fuck, uh, uh, uh. Oh my god, it's so fast. Fuck.|0
speaker_f/speaker_f_0025.wav|Uh, why are you grabbing my hair and pushing me down like this? Uh, to make sure I can't|0
speaker_m/speaker_m_0017.wav|and if it was just for my coffee, I would be equally as flattered, but I'm still. Yeah, I'm still happy that|2
speaker_f/speaker_f_0033.wav|can't move it all. And I can't cover my, uh, uh, hey. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Oh, fuck. I|0
speaker_m/speaker_m_0013.wav|mind me asking, what problem did you do give me your number today, aside from the obvious? Yeah. No, it's cool. No,|2
speaker_f/speaker_f_0027.wav|God. Oh, my God, it's so big. Stretching me open. Oh, fuck, I'm so deep. You could just shove|0
speaker_f/speaker_f_0009.wav|helpful? Not. I mean, what makes you think you could do that in the first place? I doubt you're|0
speaker_f/speaker_f_0003.wav|practically in my face as soon as you opened the door. So how could I not look at it?|0
speaker_f/speaker_f_0011.wav|bet. It's an easy win. If you can't make me scream like that in five minutes, then you have|0
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0025.wav|one who saw it, and I could capture the special occasion, but I'm getting it back to you now, aren't I? I'm letting you use it all over again. I'm going to|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0031.wav|Yeah, I feel like that might have been a, uh, working progress for a while, right? Do you feel the same way?|2
speaker_f/speaker_f_0022.wav|Oh, my God. I'm not even a bigger. Why? I'm not even possible. Hmm, whatever. It's hard now, so|0
speaker_m/speaker_m_0037.wav|a one night thing. But if, if you're only interested in that, then I totally understand. And I'm still interested in that.|2
speaker_m/speaker_m_0024.wav|I'm happy with where I am. My little get up, you know? Yeah. I mean, I enjoy people watching, you know, seeing|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0029.wav|Can you put it? You don't even want to look at you. You want to hide? Okay. Is it because you're helping the air like a fucking bitch right now? Oh, that's|1
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0027.wav|flashlight. Oh, you don't use it. No. Oh, you can fuck up into it just like that. Oh, you can use it. I'm, I'm just like you. Come here. Oh, from the|1

speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0004.wav|going to love you. Please don't. Welcome on to your school. Where I find it. You can drop that whole more at least of Rachel's act. If you really, really, really wanted|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0014.wav|honestly, like, I know you're not entirely supposed to give people your number when they're working, but I don't know. I think|2
speaker_m/speaker_m_0035.wav|it's not anything bad ever, I promise. But it's kind of a courtesy to let you know before we move ahead with|2
speaker_ff/speaker_ff_0011.wav|thing you're embarrassed about right now. Yeah. Well, I mean, your cock's getting hard from your crush getting kidnapped. Turn what the fuck? Yeah, look. Your cock is practically straining to your|1
speaker_m/speaker_m_0029.wav|to meet interesting and attractive people like you. I'd consider it a perk of the job. Obviously, I don't go around fluttering|2
